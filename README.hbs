# cs-weekly-2-material-audio-player
Implements Web Audio API to create a simple wave oscillator visualizer. Original designed classes and architecture heavily inspired by examples on MDN.
See [MDN example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Controlling_multiple_parameters_with_ConstantSourceNode)

## Writeup

I wrote a blog article discussing the Web Audio API and explaining
the program [here](https://medium.com/@vapurrmaid/c-s-weekly-2-material-wave-visualizer-and-the-web-audio-api-5a16c2af4d3b).

This project is an iteration of an effort called Code Something Weekly. The
article explaining how and why is found [here](https://medium.com/@vapurrmaid/code-something-weekly-how-and-why-44640d279ca1)
